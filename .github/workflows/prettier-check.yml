            This PR applies automated Prettier formatting across the codebase.

            Like a certain Mad Titan, Prettier is here to bring balance (of formatting) to the codebase. Inconsistent styles were temporary... this clean, consistent code? It is inevitable.

            ✨ Code aesthetic upgraded. 💯
